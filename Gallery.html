			<h2><b>Kolitong</b></h2>
            <p>A kolitong is a bamboo polychordal tube zither from the Bontok people living in the Province of Kalinga, in the Philippines. It has six bamboo fiber strings that run parallel to its tube body. The strings are numbered from one to six, from lowest to highest pitch. There are incised geometric carving in the center as decoration. The bamboo tube acts as the instruments’ resonator body with holes along the body and both ends are closed by the bamboo nodes. Each end is adorned with cloth and beads. In the Kalinga Province, men play the kolitong at night as a solo instrument. A variety of bamboo tube zithers are found throughout the Philippine archipelago, each zither differing from the other in name, size, and design depending on its associated ethnic group.
</p>

<br>
<p>Imagine sitting peacefully in the evening and suddenly a bamboo tube zither, echoing through the air.The Pagang In the Philippines during the era of the Spanish colonization, the instrumental sonorous sound called the Pagang was the central event in the social life of the locals. The Pagang, a bamboo tube zither created by Hanunoo Mangyans, was employed in the performance of various rituals, celebrations, and also in the day to day life of the participants. This instrument made from only natural materials was a unique way of interacting with a certain sound, which oftentimes was the connection of the community to the cultural and spiritual practices. It would be hard to deny the fact that the Pagang is one of the most authentic and innovative art pieces produced by the native people, who are designers of the genius in utilizing the materials around them to create an inimitable and meaningful hearing experience Hearing the Pagang played today is like stepping back in time it gives you chills to think it was part of rituals centuries ago.

            <h2><b>Spanish colonial period</b></h2>
			<h2><b>Zarzuela</b></h2>
zarzuela, form of Spanish or Spanish-derived musical theatre in which the dramatic action is carried through an alternating combination of song and speech. Topics of the libretti (texts of the productions) vary widely, ranging from stories derived from Greco-Roman mythology to tales of modern-day life in Madrid, in former Spanish colonies, or in other areas with a large Hispanic population. Most zarzuelas incorporate vocal ensemble numbers (such as trios and duets), lyrical solo songs known as romanzas, various types of local folk musics, and dance.

</p>

<br>

<p>This is the charm of Zarzuela: it kept the Filipino identity alive even in the darkest times. The audience is taken away to another place. This conglomeration of drama, music, and dance was an expression of what is more than just entertainment; they were reflections of Filipino life and culture. Zarzuela was so strong because it was a combination of many elements: cheerful pieces, touching dialogues, and regular rhythmic motion. It was not limited to mere listening to it as it widened the imagination and feelings. Although the people were under heavy restrictions due to limited freedom, it was the theater performances that would bring joy and delight to many Filipinos. Zarzuela was not just a fun thing. It quietly became a form of resistance, reminding people of their identity and unity. The country was controlled by the Japanese, but through Zarzuela, Filipinos held onto their culture, pointing out that art can be a powerful weapon, even without bullets.

			<h2><b>Bodabil</b></h2>
            <p>bodabil, was a popular genre of entertainment in the Philippines from the 1910s until the mid-1960s. For decades, it competed with film, radio and television as the dominant form of Filipino mass entertainment. It peaked in popularity during the Japanese occupation in the Philippines from 1941 to 1945. Many of the leading figures of Philippine film in the 20th century, such as Dolphy, Nora Aunor, Leopoldo Salcedo and Rogelio de la Rosa, began their showbusiness careers in bodabil.
</p>
		<br>
		<p>American Colonial Period: 
Close your eyes and imagine the Philippines in the early 1900s. Streets buzzed with life, and the sounds of blues, folk music, and rock & roll began to mix with the melodies of traditional Filipino music. These American-introduced new musical genres were more than just entertainment; they were representations of influence and transformation.  Some Americans initially found the odd sounds amusing. Native music actually lost its meaning when Americans called it "crazy." This pertained to the singing and dance of the Igorots. Instead of just sitting and gloating, the Filipinos welcomed the transformation. The 1950s marked the emergence of Philippine rock music as Filipinos, joined by a few rock movements, strongly vibrated to fast beats while performing their own songs in solid Tagalog. Fun wasn't the only purpose of the music. It evolved into a voice for a new generation, expressing feelings, stories and ambitions in a style that was both contemporary and distinctly Filipino. This energy is still present today in Original Pilipino Music (OPM), which serves as a reminder of how Filipinos can take something foreign and turn it into something that is uniquely their own. It is a perfect combination of creativity and cultural pride.

			<h2><b>Jazz</b></h2>
            <p>The Japanese discouraged jazz and the music of the western allies, and favored the creation and performance of native musical forms. Prizes were awarded to compositions utilizing native themes. Filipino composers and conductors were invited to give concerts. The impresario; Alfredo Lozano organized the New Philippine Symphony Orchestra composed of Filipino musicians. 
</p>
<br>
<p>Among all the arts that relied on the auditory medium, radio broadcasting was the most relevant during the postwar era.  Following the Second World War, radio became the central mode of bringing entertainment and information. Filipinos were interested in listening to radio drama, variety shows, and music programs, which brought a sense of connection and community in the reconstruction time. Radio played a very important role in popularizing original music and also was in the front line to revive and make Filipino music more available. A generational movement that had a significant impact on the Filipino people's cultural identity at the time, radio served as a medium for them to express oneself through music.

            <p>Folk music is a music genre that includes traditional folk music and the contemporary genre that evolved from the former during the 20th-century folk revival. Some types of folk music may be called world music. Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, music that is played on traditional instruments, music about cultural or national identity, music that changes between generations (folk process), music associated with a people's folklore, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. The term originated in the 19th century, but folk music extends beyond that.

The Moro-moro is a type of auditory art that was introduced during the Spanish Colonial period.  The performance, a combination of music and drama, was brought to the Philippines by the Spanish priests in their endeavor to spread the message of Christianity. The performances were enacted in the form of dramas, where actors dressed in costumes and communicated through music and dance, the Moro-moro emerged the performance replacing the traditional mythological performances, as the colonizers tried to promote the Filipino version of the Spanish drama by changing the indigenous culture, the Moro-moro, which was a mix of Spanish and Filipino influences, became a cultural landmark, if you had to adapt one of these traditions today, what would it look or sound like?

They also introduced new types of music that became popular, and the sounds of native Igorot villages were considered strange and frightening by some U.S. Americans. The U.S. introduced American blues, folk music, R&B, and rock & roll, which became popular. In the late 1950s, native performers adapted Tagalog lyrics to North American rock & roll music, which led to the origins of Philippine rock.

            <p>TLiterature, traditionally a visual art form, has evolved into an auditory experience in contemporary Philippines. Performance poetry and spoken word have revitalized the oral tradition, emphasizing the musicality of language. Audiobooks and podcasts have made literature more accessible, allowing listeners to immerse themselves in stories through sound. Literary adaptations into radio plays, podcasts, and audio dramas have brought new life to classic works. The interplay of language, rhythm, and dialect further enhances the auditory dimension of literature, making it a captivating and multifaceted art form in the contemporary Philippine context.

<br>
<p>Literature The new age of literature in the Philippines is one of the auditory forms that have now been more contemporary. The rise of spoken word and performance poetry has given us a chance to hear lots of literary works that would have been the same without the audio, but they draw our attention to the importance of vocal energy, rhythm, and voice tuning. Audio books, as well as the trendy podcasts, have also made literature more accessible to the people by going with them as they listen to the stories and poems. Because they inspired the classic texts and made them more accessible to contemporary readers, literary works like radio plays and audio dramas have been known to engage listeners.
