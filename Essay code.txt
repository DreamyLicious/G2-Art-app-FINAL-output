                <h2>History of Kulintang</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>KULINTANG.</b> is a traditional Philippine music form that originated in the indigenous cultures of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago. It is an important aspect of Southeast Asia's gong-chime tradition, having a rich cultural history and unique instrumentation. Kulintang has a 1,700-year history that includes significant religious influences such as Islam and Christianity. It evolved from simple native signaling practices to a sophisticated form established by the Sundanese people of Java, Indonesia. The music is mainly orchestral and based on a pentatonic scale, allowing for freedom in interpretation. Unlike other Southeast Asian ensembles, kulintang emphasizes creative improvisation within a loosely structured style, which improves the dynamic quality. Kulintang is used as both an entertainment medium and a way for indigenous tribes to preserve their cultural identity.

					<b>Spanish Colonial Period: Kundiman.</b>
					Love, longing, and patriotism are all embodied in the ancient Filipino music known as kundiman. From basic folk songs to significant artistic creations that speak to the Filipino character, it began in the early 19th century. "Kundiman" is derived from the Tagalog expression "kung hindi man," which reflects the songs' bittersweet feelings. In the Philippines, Kundiman music first appeared during the Spanish colonial era, especially in Balayan, Batangas. Songs like "Bayan Ko" became anthems for independence seekers and subtly expressed messages of resistance against colonial powers. Composers such as Francisco Santiago and Nicanor Abelardo were instrumental in formalizing and enhancing the genre; Santiago is known as the "Father of Kundiman Art Song." The emotional resonance of kundiman connects deeply with listeners, creating unity and national identity.

                <h2>History of Kubing instrument</h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever heard or tried using a kubing from a pre-colonial petiod before?. According to a Fillipino Musician Dino Labiste "kubing is a type of jaw harp made from a hand carved piece of bamboo". This has 4.5 in. long incised tongue has two sections: a wider one, 2.8 in. long, that is connected to the frame; and a narrower one, 1.7 in. long, that is the actual vibrating component of the instrument. Among the Mindanao tribes (Maguindanao and Maranao), this traditional musical instrument is called "Kubing". In Cotabato it is called "Kulaing", in Visayas it is " Subing",  in the Tagalogs it is "Barmbaw", it is " Kollibaw" in Negritos,  "kinaban" in the Hanunoo Mangyans, "afiw* (made of metal) in the Bontocs, and lastly, "coding" among the Ibaloys and Kalingas. The uniqueness and simplicity of the kubing’s appearance belies the complexity of its acoustic mechanisms, for while it acts primarily as a lamellaphone is also to some extent an aerophone. The frame of the kubing is held in the left hand and pressed against a player's lips facing outward, using his mouth cavity as a resonating chamber. The primary source of sound is actuated as the player flexes and releases the tip of the frame with his or her right thumb or index finger.

                <p>
                    The <b>tongatong</b> is a drum-like instrument created from bamboo of different lengths traditionally used by the Kalinga in house blessings to commune with spirits. By hitting the bamboo against the ground it produces a peculiar sound made by the vibration released through the instrument’s open mouth that can vary depending on its length, and it is mostly played as a set to put the dancers and the audience in a trance.
